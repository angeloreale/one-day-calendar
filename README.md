# One Day Calendar

This app consists of a one day static timetable that plugs events into their respective time and handle the overlap of events by splitting them into columns.

Areas that need improvement:
- Calendar component tests could be more thorough to account for edge cases.
- Calendar component evaluate events logic has a large big O, and could be further optimized.
