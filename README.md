# One Day Calendar

This app consists of a one day static timetable that plugs events into their respective time and handle the overlap of events by splitting them into columns.

This app was bootstrapped by CRA, setup with Airbnb ESlint standards, and unint tested using Jest and Enzyme.

Live demo: [https://angeloreale.com/one-day-calendar/index.html]

Key commands:
- `npm run start` starts local.
- `npm run test` starts tests watcher.
- `npm run lint` runs linter.
- `npm run build` builds static files.

Areas that need improvement:
- Calendar component tests could be more thorough to account for edge cases.
- Calendar component evaluate events logic has a large big O, and could be further optimized.
